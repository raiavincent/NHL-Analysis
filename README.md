# NHL-Analysis
This is a project to determine the charecteristics of NHL team, like what goes into a win, and how we can determine what goes into top ranked players, their value, find a way to compare two players, etc.

This project consistently edits and google sheet dashboard and a folder of stats on certain dates.
